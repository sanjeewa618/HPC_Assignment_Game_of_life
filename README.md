# Conway's Game of Life (Interactive GUI with CUDA GPU & Multi-Threaded CPU)

A feature-complete, modern graphical application of **Conway's Game of Life** built with standard **C++14**, **SDL2**, and **NVIDIA CUDA**. 

It features an embedded graphical user interface (GUI) with interactive controls, pattern libraries, canvas zooming/panning, and a dual-engine architecture that runs out-of-the-box on standard CPUs (via OpenMP) while seamlessly utilizing NVIDIA CUDA GPUs when hardware acceleration is available.

---

## Key Features

- **Dynamic Massive Grid Resizing**:
  - Live grid resizing directly from the GUI or hotkeys without restarting the app!
  - **Presets**: `256x256` (65K), `512x512` (262K), `1024x1024` (1M cells), `2048x2048` (4M cells), `4096x4096` (16.8M ULTRA cells), and `1920x1080` (FHD 2M cells).
  - Automatically re-centers camera and recalculates textures seamlessly.
- **Modern Embedded GUI**:
  - **Header Bar**: Displays current active compute engine badge, real-time FPS counter, generation count, live population count, and grid resolution with million-cell metric tags.
  - **Sidebar Control Panel**: Organized control sections for simulation playback, speed presets, drawing tools, brush sizes, pattern libraries, compute engine, camera, and grid resolutions.
  - **Bottom Status Bar**: Live cursor grid coordinate tracking, cell state inspector, active tool indicator, and zoom level.
  - **Zero External Font Dependencies**: Built-in 8x8 font atlas rendered directly with hardware-accelerated SDL2.
- **Dual-Engine Architecture**:
  - **Multi-Threaded CPU Engine (OpenMP)**: Highly optimized parallel stencil calculation with toroidal wrapping and parallel reduction for live cell counting. Runs on any computer (Intel, AMD, etc.) without requiring an NVIDIA GPU.
  - **CUDA GPU Hardware Acceleration**: Utilizes 2D thread blocks (`16x16`), on-device ARGB pixel generation, pinned host memory (`cudaMallocHost`), on-GPU pseudorandom hash initialization, and GPU-side brush drawing.
  - **Dynamic Switching**: Switch between CPU and GPU engines on the fly from the GUI while preserving the grid state!
- **Interactive Canvas with Camera**:
  - **Zoom**: Smooth zooming in and out (10% to 3200%) centered on mouse cursor via scroll wheel.
  - **Pan**: Smooth dragging across large worlds with the middle mouse button.
  - **View Presets**: Instant "Reset View (1:1)" and "Fit Canvas" buttons.
- **Drawing Tools & Pattern Stamp Library**:
  - **Pen Mode**: Click or drag with the left mouse button to paint living cells.
  - **Erase Mode**: Click or drag with right mouse button (or Pen in Erase mode) to kill cells.
  - **Configurable Brush Sizes**: 1x1, 3x3, 5x5 brush diameters.
  - **Pattern Presets**: Stamp classic Conway patterns directly into the universe:
    - *Glider* (traveling spaceship)
    - *Gosper Glider Gun* (infinite factory producing moving gliders)
    - *Pulsar* (period-3 oscillator)
    - *Pentadecathlon* (period-15 oscillator)
    - *Acorn* (methuselah evolving for over 5,000 generations)
    - *Diehard* (vanishes after 130 generations)
    - Live translucent placement ghost preview follows your cursor before stamping!
- **Automatic Build Detection**:
  - Running `make` automatically inspects your environment. If `nvcc` is detected, it compiles with full CUDA hardware acceleration. If not (such as on standard laptops), it automatically compiles with the multi-threaded CPU engine without errors.

## Building and Running

### 1. Automatic Build (Recommended)

Just run `make`. It will detect whether your machine has the NVIDIA CUDA Toolkit (`nvcc`):
```bash
make
./game_of_life
```

You can optionally specify grid dimensions (e.g. 512x512, 800x600, 1024x1024):
```bash
./game_of_life 800 600
```

### 2. Desktop Application Installation (Installable App)

To install Conway's Game of Life as a native desktop application with an icon in your application launcher and on your desktop:

```bash
make install
```
This automatically:
- Installs the executable to `~/.local/bin/game_of_life`
- Installs the high-resolution app icon to `~/.local/share/icons/hicolor/scalable/apps/game-of-life.svg`
- Registers the desktop entry to `~/.local/share/applications/game-of-life.desktop`
- Adds a shortcut right onto your `Desktop` (`~/Desktop/game-of-life.desktop`)

You can now launch the app from:
1. Your **GNOME / Desktop Application Menu** (press the `Super`/Windows key and search `Game of Life`).
2. Double-clicking the **Desktop icon**.
3. Running `game_of_life` from any terminal.

To cleanly uninstall at any time:
```bash
make uninstall
```

### 3. Explicit Target Builds

- **Force Multi-Threaded CPU build** (runs on any PC with `g++` and SDL2):
  ```bash
  make cpu
  ./game_of_life
  ```
- **Force CUDA GPU build** (requires an NVIDIA GPU and `nvcc`):
  ```bash
  make cuda
  ./game_of_life
  ```

## Automated CI/CD Builds (Windows `.exe` & macOS `.dmg`)

This repository includes a ready-to-use **GitHub Actions Workflow** (`.github/workflows/build-artifacts.yml`) that automatically compiles and packages installable files for all major operating systems on every push or manual trigger:

| Target OS | Output File | Description |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Windows** | `game-of-life-windows-setup.exe` | Complete Inno Setup installer wizard |
| **Windows** | `game-of-life-windows-x64.zip` | Standalone portable `.exe` with bundled `SDL2.dll` |
| **macOS** | `game-of-life-macos.dmg` | Native Apple `.app` bundle inside `.dmg` disk image |
| **Linux** | `game-of-life-linux-x64.tar.gz` | Standalone Linux archive with icon and installer script |

### How to Trigger the Workflow:
1. **Manual Run**:
   - Go to your repository on GitHub: `https://github.com/SeniduRavihara/Game_Of_Life`
   - Click the **Actions** tab.
   - Select **"Build Desktop Applications"** on the left.
   - Click **Run workflow** -> **Run workflow**.
   - Download the generated `.dmg` and `.exe` files directly from the run summary under **Artifacts**!
2. **Automated on Git Tag (Releases)**:
   - When you create a release tag (e.g. `v1.0.0`), GitHub Actions will build all targets and automatically attach `game-of-life-windows-setup.exe` and `game-of-life-macos.dmg` directly to the GitHub Release!
